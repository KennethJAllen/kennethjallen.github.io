# Portfolio

I've worked on numerous projects related to mathematical modeling, simulations, and engineering. From simulating high energy plasma in tokamak fusion reactors, to using graph theory to model card games.

# About Me

![](assets/images/aboutme.jpg)

I am a Data Scientist with a PhD is in Mathematics and research on machine learning, fusion simulations, data completion, and low-rank matrix and tensor completion. My preferred programing languages are Python and SQL, as well as MATLAB and Lisp.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, trying different restaurants with great food, and exploring coffee shops.
